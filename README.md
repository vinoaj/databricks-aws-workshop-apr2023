#### Z-Ordering

- Delta Lake orders the data in the Parquet files to make range selection on object storage more efficient
- Limit the number of columns in the Z-Order to the best 1-4

#### ANALYZE

`ANALYZE TABLE db_name.table_name COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR ALL COLUMNS`

- Utilised for [Adaptive Query Execution](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/spark-sql/aqe.html) (AQE), re-optimisations that occur during query execution
- 3 major features of AQE
  - Coalescing post-shuffle partitions (combine small partitions into reasonably sized partitions)
  - Converting sort-merge joins to broadcast hash joins
  - Skew join optimisation by splitting (and replicating if needed) skewed tasks into roughly evenly sized tasks
  - Dynamically detects and propagates empty relations
- `ANALYZE TABLE` collects table statistics that allows AQE to know which plan to choose for you
